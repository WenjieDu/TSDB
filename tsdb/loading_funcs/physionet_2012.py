def load_physionet2012(local_path):
    """Load dataset PhysioNet Challenge 2012, which is a time-series classification dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    local_path : str,
        The local path of dir saving the raw data of PhysioNet Challenge 2012.

    Returns
    -------
    data : dict
        A dictionary contains X and y:
            X : pandas.DataFrame,
                Time-series feature vectors.
            y : pandas.Series,
                Classification labels.

    Notes
    -----
    The preprocessing workflow is the same with the one used in paper :cite:`du2023SAITS`.
    All samples contain 48 time steps. Truncated if the sample has more than 48 steps. Padded if
    the sample has less than 48 steps. Static features such as 'Age', 'Gender', 'ICUType', 'Height',
    are removed. Column 'Time' also gets removed. Following 12 samples are dropped because of containing
    no time-series information at all: 147514, 142731, 145611, 140501, 155655, 143656, 156254, 150309,
